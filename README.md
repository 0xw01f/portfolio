## About

w01fgram is a very simple clone of Instagram. This was created following [Victor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQI-Ym2rLZx52vEoqlPQMdg)'s tutorial on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ). And improved by myself later.
w01fgram has a really poor name, and I'm sorry for that, but it is capable of :

- User management (Register/Login).
- Profile creation for each new user.
- Send a welcome email to each new user.
- User has the ability to post pictures with a caption.
- User has the ability to edit his profile (name/description/link)
- User can follow and be followed from other users
- User can see the posts from followed users on the main page

## Cyber cats
## About cyber cats 🐱‍💻
The future of cats already exists, an intercatlactical traveller who's commonly known as 'Pawfinder' gave me some **high** confidential information about his future. His mission ended there, because his paws are unfortunately not made for coding.
Now these information are in my own hands, and my job is to share you what he found.
Hang on ! Because your knowledge is nothing concerning this future. ✨

![Cat Search](https://i.imgur.com/56yM5DS.png)

It uses **Vue.js** with **Axios** to call an **API** to get all the cat information.

OFFLINE status is animated.

# Scripting

## BrightSign-File-Converter
A simple python tool to convert files organized by a BrightSign system to human-readable files


As BrightSign's documentation says.
>With BrightAuthor 2.2, files published for Simple File Networking updates now reside in the Pool folder.
These files are named using their hash key values, so they have no extensions.

These files are in a Pool folder, and then distributed in a bunch of other files.
![Hash Example](https://i.imgur.com/LNF6cOH.png)

An XML file is also created, to list each file whith its details.
![WML Content](https://i.imgur.com/pNH32Yt.png)

thanks to this file I was able to get all the files and rename them, while putting them back to the right folder.
All you have to do, is to create two folders. One named `SORTED FILES` and the otehr one named `UNSORTED FILES`.
Be sure that your XML file has the same name than mine, and put it with the pool folder in `UNSORTED FILES`.

I think nobody is ever gonna use this, but I hope it will be helpful to somebody one day...
